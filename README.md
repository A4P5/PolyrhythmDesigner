Polyrhythm Designer!

Enter any rhythm like 3:4, 9:8 or even 85:23, there really isn't any limits! (except ur hardware)

How to get started:
 - Install Python (3.11)
 - Install packages:
     - pip install pygame
     - pip install math
 - Run the program ("PolyrhythmDesigner.py")
 - Enter your polyrhythm!

Make sure your audio files are in the same directory, and also named ("beat.wav" and "beat2.wav")

Soon im adding multiple polyrhythms fx. 3:4:2 or 5:2:9:8
